    From script to screen, thousands of people are involved, and the whole production

    in the millions. Major costs are spent on paying staff, CGI, special effects and 
    marketing. However, not all expensive movies are popular or rated highly among the

    production because based on the chances of success, they are able to proceed from the 
    concept and idea brainstorming step to the budgeting, casting and filming step. By 
    compiling three datasets with categories such as genre, rating and revenue and creating
    multiple visuals, we hope to see a correlation between movie budget and rating."),
