## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/calc_sum_info.R")
```


### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- year_max_revenue
msg1 <- netflix_movie_number
msg2 <- unique_genres
msg3 <- highest_domestic_gross
msg4 <- highest_opening_weekend
msg5 <- highest_production_cost
msg6 <- highest_imdb_score
```

> `r msg` `r msg1` `r msg2` `r msg3` `r msg4` `r msg5` `r msg6`

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
