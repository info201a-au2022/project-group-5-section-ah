## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/calc_sum_info.R")
source("../source/chart1.R")
source("../source/chart2.R")
source("../source/chart3.R")

```


### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- year_max_revenue
msg1 <- netflix_movie_number
msg2 <- unique_genres
msg3 <- highest_domestic_gross
msg4 <- highest_opening_weekend
msg5 <- highest_production_cost
msg6 <- highest_imdb_score
msg7 <- highest_opening_weekend
```

> `r msg` `r msg1` `r msg2` `r msg3` `r msg4` `r msg5` `r msg6` `r msg7`

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r chart2, echo=FALSE}
plot(chart2)
```

This chart expresses the relationship between the production cost of a given movie title and the actual Worldwide gross of said movie. This comparison is meant to describe the size of correlation between the amount a director decided to spend on a movie and how much that investment (or lack of investment) affected the overall profitability of said movie title. As we can see, the movie with the highest production cost is Avengers: Endgame, which is also the second most grossed movie. Additionally, the movie titled: Avatar, had a production budget/cost of only half that of Avengers: Endgame, but still managed to gross more money. This means that the worldwide gross of a movie may not be as tied to the production cost of a movie as we had initially thought.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```

```{r chart3, echo=FALSE}
chart3
```

This chart allows users to explore which genres were the most abundant in the top 500 movies dataset. You can click into the different "bubbles" to reveal the specific genre and how many times it appears. Looking at the data, the adventure genre is the most popular followed by the action genre, which is unsurprising. This is followed by a large drop in number to drama, thriller, comedy, and five more genres. This data is important because it reveals which genres generally perform the best and worst. As you can see, the western genre does not have many movies in the top 500, so it's not a good choice if you were to make a movie.
