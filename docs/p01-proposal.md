## Abstract

Our main question is “How does a Movie’s budget affect its ratings?” This question is important because it can help professional or amateur directors determine whether a high budget is beneficial to the movie's overall feedback. To address the question, we will compare various movie’s reviews and budgets. We are also concerned with how a movie’s budget affects its gross. To address this concern, we plan to compare various movie’s budgets and grosses. Other important information about movies can be viewed and compared with the data.


## Keywords

Movies, television, reviews, budget, gross


## Introduction

Movies are one the major forms of digital entertainment. From script to screen, thousands of people are involved, and the whole production takes quite a while. As grand of a scale it is, the average movie budget ranges in the millions. Major costs are spent on paying staff, CGI, special effects and marketing. However, not all expensive movies are popular or rated highly among the audience. To investigate this deeper, we strove to discover how budget could impact a movie’s overall ratings. This is a crucial question for people involved in movie production because based on the chances of success, they are able to proceed from the concept and idea brainstorming step to the budgeting, casting and filming step. By compiling three datasets with categories such as genre, rating and revenue and creating multiple visuals, we hope to see a correlation between movie budget and rating. 
## Problem Domain

### Background- describe topic, setting

- Movies take a lot of people, time and money to make. Developments in technology, acceleration in production and improved quality drive the growth of movies. As a popular sought source of entertainment, the movie industry is constantly creating new ideas and ways to attract the audience. One of the ways to visually upgrade movies is through special effects and increasing production size. To accomplish this, an extensive budget is needed. Although a larger budget may allow a movie to look visually appealing, how well it is received by the audience is difficult to accurately predict. This is because movie reviews are not solely rated on technical aspects but also examine the content regarding violence, language, drug use and popular issues during that time. It should also be factored that ratings are done by people of diverse morals and cultural backgrounds. 

### Project Framing

### Direct and Indirect Stakeholders

- Direct stakeholders might include movie/TV directors, employees of media companies, businesses, and educational organizations. Indirect stakeholders may include individual consumers of movies/TV shows and actors/actresses.

### Human Values

- Entertainment media such as movies and television are important to many people. By using personal biases and others’ reviews, people are able to determine which movies or television shows are worth their time to consume. Movies and TV shows are often used to bring people together or to strengthen relationships. Movies and TV shows allow people to experience emotions they wouldn’t normally experience, allowing for a unique and potentially life changing experience. Movies and TV shows are also a way for countries or specific groups of people to show their pride. There are many genres, some which are intended to be educational, and others entertainment. Young children and toddlers use movies and TV shows to learn about our world and more.

### Potential Benefits and Harms

- One potential benefit of finding the answers to our proposed research question is developing a standard reference/statement for correlation between the budget and overall success of films. This statement can be pulled upon in order to develop a quick prediction or decision based on a few given factors. Although this is beneficial, it may generate fabricated opinions. In general, theories that predict and assume total outcomes can be found misleading. It is important to take these discovered correlations from a more reserved standpoint.

## Research Questions

How does the budget of a movie correlate with the overall success of said movie?
- We want to know if there is a noticeable increase in viewing numbers, gross income, and reviews in relation to the budget of a given movie as compared to a movie with a lesser budget.

Does a specific actor's presence correlate with the box office revenues of the movies they star in?

- We want to find out whether specific actors star exclusively in successful, profitable, and highly rated movies.
- This question is important in figuring out if it is clear that specific actors boost the viewing numbers of the films they are in.
- By locating/identifying these actors, we can also identify which ones are more valuable and will therefore increase the budget of a movie.

How do the total profit and viewing numbers of a movie relate to its sequel?
- We want to know if the box office numbers are usually higher for the sequel, given the 1st movie created the exposure, following, and fanbase.
- We also want to understand how the budget of a sequel movie compares to its preceding movie.


## Dataset

Our largest dataset includes general information about over 15,000 movies. While it does not include information about movie’s budgets and grosses, it does include reviews from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and awards. By using our second and third dataset which includes the top 500 movies by production budget and box office revenue by year in the U.S. and Canada, we can answer our question by comparing the movie budgets and grosses with reviews.

### Who collected the data? When? For what purpose?

- All of this data was collected from 2021 or later. A person named Ashish Gupta collected the large 15,000+ dataset, Box Office Mojo collected the annual box office revenue dataset, and a person named Mitchell Harrison collected the 500 movie dataset. This data was collected to be viewed by anyone for their own purposes. It is intended to be educational.

### How was the data collection effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money? 

- Two datasets were not funded. The other was possibly funded by IMDb but there is no official documentation that it was. Movie or TV directors could possibly use this data to attempt to create a new movie or TV show with the purpose of profiting. Anyone can use this data to learn from it as well.

### How was the data validated and held secure? Is it credible and trustworthy? 

- Two datasets are stored on the Kaggle website, a trustworthy website which stores various datasets for various topics. The other dataset is stored on Statista, another credible website which stores datasets.

## Expected Implications

Using our data, we will be able to compare differences between movie/TV show budgets, reviews, grosses, and more. This will allow others to see if there is any correlation between said sections. These correlations might allow movie directors or others to determine whether choices regarding budget or other factors will impact the reviews or grosses. Another possible implication includes finding correlations between a movie/TV show’s language, release year, genre, and other subtopics. This can help us find imbalances between reviews or other forms of judging credibility possibly. For example, we might find that one language’s movies/TV shows have unnaturally high or low average reviews, which could lead to more questions about imbalances or other topics. We also might find a correlation between a movie’s length and reviews or grosses which could lead to more questions.

## Expected Limitations

One limitation might include some movies not being included in both movie datasets. To address this limitation, we can manually input movie data to correct the absence. Another limitation might include absences of some movie reviews. Some movies in the dataset do not include reviews, but most do. This can be solved by possibly manually inputting missing reviews. Movie reviews are also hard to gauge because different people/websites have different ways of judging how good a movie is. A small introductory blurb about this is all we can really do about this limitation, but overall, movie reviews are mostly agreeable.
